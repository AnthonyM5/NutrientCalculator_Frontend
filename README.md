# NutrientCalculator
This Javscript based application will allow you to build meals using nutrient profiles from the Food Data Central API (<a href='https://github.com/antimonysayz/NutrientCalculator_Backend/blob/master/README.md'>Read More</a>
and render an aggregated nutrient profile of your meal.  The combined meal data can help in unique cases like calorie counting meals, specific nutrient intake counts, and much more.
